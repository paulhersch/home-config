## My Desktop config files
Most of my configs are built by homemanager (you wont find me creating colorschemes in here...) but you can find that config in my nixdots repo

Material icons are obviously taken from Google, although some are [Phosphoricons](https://phosphoricons.com/).

The Weather icons are taken from [the open-weather-icons Repo](https://github.com/isneezy/open-weather-icons) because i was too lazy finding proper icons myself.
